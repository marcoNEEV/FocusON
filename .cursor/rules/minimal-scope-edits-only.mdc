# Rule Description:
Cursor must only modify the code that is explicitly mentioned in the user prompt. Do not touch or refactor:
- Unrelated code
- Nearby functions or logic
- Other files not named in the request

# If Cursor Identifies:
- A bug
- A performance issue
- A code smell or security concern → Cursor should ask the user whether to fix it, but must not proceed automatically.

**Goal:
The goal is to respect the user’s intended scope of change, especially when working step-by-step or in a sensitive project context.
