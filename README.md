## Installation

## ðŸ”‹ Sleep Prevention System

FocusON uses macOS's IOKit to prevent the system from sleeping during active focus sessions.

### Key Implementation Details:
- Uses `kIOPMAssertionTypePreventUserIdleSystemSleep` (via `IOPMAssertionCreateWithName`) to block idle sleep only while the timer is running.
- Sleep prevention is **safely released** when:
  - the timer is paused or reset
  - the app is quit or terminated
  - the timer deinitializes (as a safeguard)
- This ensures the app never leaves behind active sleep assertions that could drain battery or cause heating issues.

### Debug Logging

To track sleep assertions and app state changes, FocusON includes a state-aware logging system:
- Logging is **enabled only in DEBUG builds** using `#if DEBUG`.
- You can toggle logging on/off with the `enableDebugLogging` flag.
- Logs are optimized to avoid repetition (e.g., logging only when the UI or state changes).
- All key user actions (start, pause, reset, quit) and assertion events are logged.

To enable debug logs, set:

```swift
let enableDebugLogging = true
```
